We (a.k.a. the folks at New School Old School, LLC, or the "Company") run an application called Interviewbud. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of the Interviewbud application (the "Application"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review [here](/terms).

 Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by New School Old School LLC, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.

Use of our Services may require an Interviewbud account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your login. You are responsible for keeping your login secure.

### Interviewbud Account

If you create an account on Interviewbud to save your question answers, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the content. You must immediately notify New School Old School, LLC of any unauthorized uses of your content, your account, or any other breaches of security. New School Old School, LLC will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.


### Interviewbud Content

If you operate an Interviewbud account, post material to Interviewbud, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Interviewbud, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct does not contain the following:

* **Illegal content**
* **Intellectual property infringement**
* **Pornography**
* **Technologically harmful content:** Please don’t upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.
* **Impersonation:** Don’t claim to be a person or organization you’re not. 
* **Directly threatening material:** Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence—or death—against an individual person, or groups of persons. This doesn’t mean that we’ll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.


Bear in mind that these are just guidelines — interpretations are up to us. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.

### Changes

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on Interviewbud.com, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
