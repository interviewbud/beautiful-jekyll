This document is part of New School Old School LLC's [Terms of Service](/terms), and by using Inteviewbud (the “Application”), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. Please read the Terms of Service in their entirety, and refer to those for definitions and contacts.

## Data Collected

We collect anonymous data from every user of the Application to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the device type, and a timestamp for the request.

We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as email address) in order to be able to save your profile and the interview question answers associated with it. You are able to view data associated with your profile. Should you choose to delete your account, please contact us at info@interviewbud.com and we will follow up with such request as soon as possible.

Minors and children should not use Interviewbud. By using the Application, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement.

## Use of the Data

We only use your personal information to provide you the Docracy services or to communicate with you about the services or the Website.

We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:

* doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;
* we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;
* we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
* otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.

Interviewbud is operated from the United States. If you are visiting the Website from outside the U.S., you agree to any processing of any personal information you provide us according to this policy.

Interviewbud may contact you, by email or other means. For example, Docracy may send you promotional emails relating to Interviewbud or other third parties Interviewbud feels you would be interested in, or communicate with you about your use of the Interviewbud application. Interviewbud may also use technology to alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us. You can modify your email notification preferences by clicking the appropriate link included in the footer of email notifications. If you do not want to receive email from Interviewbud, please opt out of receiving emails at the bottom of any Interviewbud emails.

### Sharing of Data

We don't share your personal information with third parties. Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Interviewbud Application and service. We currently use Google Analytics (traffic analysis), Mailchimp (mailing list management), and Crashlytics (analytics). We listed below what data these third parties extract exactly. Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.

* Google Analytics: anonymous (device type, demographics, language settings, screen views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)
* Mailchimp: name and email of registered user list
* Crashlytics: anonymous, pseudonymous, registered users' activity.


We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share personal information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
